With this webbased tool it is easy to create Insights into your data through visualizations, hence the name Nsight.

It supports loading xlsx, csv and parquet files and enables you to transform your data before visualizing it.
For example you can easily scale your data.

In the last Tab Data Exploration you can create visualizations of your data. 
You can create several plots and tables of your data:

Each plot and table can be exported and saved under a path and name your can specify.
This makes it easy to dokument the exploration of your dataset.

I hope you have a lot of fun using Nsight. If there are any issues or ideas, feel free to create a issue :D
